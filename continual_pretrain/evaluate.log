Răspuns: A

Context: Brazilia este cea mai mare țară Romano-Catolică de pe Pământ, iar Biserica Romano-Catolică s-a opus, în mod sistematic, legalizării căsătoriei între persoanele de același sex în țară. Congresul Național al Braziliei a discutat legalizarea timp de 10 ani, iar astfel de căsătorii civile sunt în prezent legale doar în Rio Grande do Sul. Proiectul de lege original a fost elaborat de fostul primar al orașului São Paulo, Marta Suplicy. Legislația propusă este acum în mâinile lui Roberto Jefferson, după ce a fost modificată. Protestatarii speră să colecteze 1,2 milioane de semnături pentru petiție, urmând a o prezenta la Congresul Național din noiembrie.
Întrebare: Cui i-au dat protestatarii petiția lor?
Variante: Biserica Romano-Catolică
B: Roberto Jefferson
C: Congresul Național al Braziliei

Context: La cinci minute de la începerea prezentării, vântul își face simțită prezența; aproximativ un minut mai târziu, vântul ajunge la 70 km/h... apoi vine ploaia, dar atât de tare și cu picături atât de mari încât îți lovește pielea ca un ac, apoi a căzut grindina, iar oamenii au intrat în panică, țipând și călcându-se în picioare. „«Am pierdut-o pe sora mea și pe prietena ei, iar pe drum erau două persoane invalide în scaune cu rotile, oamenii pur și simplu săreau peste ele și le împingeau», a spus Armand Versace.”

Context: Brazilia este cea mai mare țară Romano-Catolică de pe Pământ, iar Biserica Romano-Catolică s-a opus, în mod sistematic, legalizării căsătoriei între persoanele de același sex în țară. Congresul Național al Braziliei a discutat legalizarea timp de 10 ani, iar astfel de căsătorii civile sunt în prezent legale doar în Rio Grande do Sul. Proiectul de lege original a fost elaborat de fostul primar al orașului São Paulo, Marta Suplicy. Legislația propusă este acum în mâinile lui Roberto Jefferson, după ce a fost modificată. Protestatarii speră să colecteze 1,2 milioane de semnături pentru petiție, urmând a o prezenta la Congresul Național din noiembrie.

Fondată în 1926 de către Radio Corporation of America (RCA), NBC este cea mai veche rețea de difuzare majoră din Statele Unite.
La acel moment societatea-mamă a RCA era General Electric (GE).
În 1930, GE a fost forțată să vândă companiile ca urmare a taxelor antitrust.
În 1986, controlul asupra NBC a revenit companiei General Electric (GE) prin achiziționarea RCA de 6,4 miliarde de dolari (GE mai târziu a lichidat RCA, dar a păstrat NBC).
În urma achiziției de către GE, Bob Wright a fost director general al NBC, rămânând în această funcție până la pensionarea sa în 2007, când a fost urmat de Jeff Zucker.
În 2003, compania franceză de media Vivendi și-a fuzionat activele de divertisment cu GE, formând NBC Universal.
Comcast a achiziționat un interes de control în companie în 2011 și a achiziționat pachetul majoritar deținut de General Electric în 2013.
În urma fuziunii Comcast, Zucker a părăsit NBCUniversal și a fost înlocuit ca director general, de Steve Burke, director Comcast.
NBC are 13 posturi deținute și operate și aproape 200 de afiliați în Statele Unite și teritoriile sale, dintre care unele sunt disponibile și în Canada și / sau Mexic prin intermediul furnizorilor de televiziune cu plată sau în zonele de frontieră în aer;
NBC menține, de asemenea, acorduri de licențiere de marcă pentru canalele internaționale din Coreea de Sud și Germania.

Context: Brazilia este cea mai mare țară Romano-Catolică de pe Pământ, iar Biserica Romano-Catolică s-a opus, în mod sistematic, legalizării căsătoriei între persoanele de același sex în țară. Congresul Național al Braziliei a discutat legalizarea timp de 10 ani, iar astfel de căsătorii civile sunt în prezent legale doar în Rio Grande do Sul. Proiectul de lege original a fost elaborat de fostul primar al orașului São Paulo, Marta Suplicy. Legislația propusă este acum în mâinile lui Roberto Jefferson, după ce a fost modificată. Protestatarii speră să colecteze 1,2 milioane de semnături pentru petiție, urmând a o prezenta la Congresul Național din noiembrie.
Întrebare: Cui i-au dat protestatarii petiția lor?

Fondată în 1926 de către Radio Corporation of America (RCA), NBC este cea mai veche rețea de difuzare majoră din Statele Unite.
La acel moment societatea-mamă a RCA era General Electric (GE).
În 1930, GE a fost forțată să vândă companiile ca urmare a taxelor antitrust.
În 1986, controlul asupra NBC a revenit companiei General Electric (GE) prin achiziționarea RCA de 6,4 miliarde de dolari (GE mai târziu a lichidat RCA, dar a păstrat NBC).
În urma achiziției de către GE, Bob Wright a fost director general al NBC, rămânând în această funcție până la pensionarea sa în 2007, când a fost urmat de Jeff Zucker.
În 2003, compania franceză de media Vivendi și-a fuzionat activele de divertisment cu GE, formând NBC Universal.
Comcast a achiziționat un interes de control în companie în 2011 și a achiziționat pachetul majoritar deținut de General Electric în 2013.
În urma fuziunii Comcast, Zucker a părăsit NBCUniversal și a fost înlocuit ca director general, de Steve Burke, director Comcast.
NBC are 13 posturi deținute și operate și aproape 200 de afiliați în Statele Unite și teritoriile sale, dintre care unele sunt disponibile și în Canada și / sau Mexic prin intermediul furnizorilor de televiziune cu plată sau în zonele de frontieră în aer;
NBC menține, de asemenea, acorduri de licențiere de marcă pentru canalele internaționale din Coreea de Sud și Germania.

Congresul Național al Braziliei a discutat legalizarea timp de 10 ani, iar astfel de căsătorii civile sunt în prezent legale doar în Rio Grande do Sul. Proiectul de lege original a fost elaborat de fostul primar al orașului São Paulo, Marta Suplicy. Legislația propusă este acum în mâinile lui Roberto Jefferson, după ce a fost modificată. Protestatarii speră să colecteze 1,2 milioane de semnături pentru petiție, urmând a o prezenta la Congresul Național din noiembrie.

Fondată în 1926 de către Radio Corporation of America (RCA), NBC este cea mai veche rețea de difuzare majoră din Statele Unite.
La acel moment societatea-mamă a RCA era General Electric (GE).
În 1930, GE a fost forțată să vândă companiile ca urmare a taxelor antitrust.
În 1986, controlul asupra NBC a revenit companiei General Electric (GE) prin achiziționarea RCA de 6,4 miliarde de dolari (GE mai târziu a lichidat RCA, dar a păstrat NBC).
În urma achiziției de către GE, Bob Wright a fost director general al NBC, rămânând în această funcție până la pensionarea sa în 2007, când a fost urmat de Jeff Zucker.
În 2003, compania franceză de media Vivendi și-a fuzionat activele de divertisment cu GE, formând NBC Universal.
Comcast a achiziționat un interes de control în companie în 2011 și a achiziționat pachetul majoritar deținut de General Electric în 2013.
În urma fuziunii Comcast, Zucker a părăsit NBCUniversal și a fost înlocuit ca director general, de Steve Burke, director Comcast.
NBC are 13 posturi deținute și operate și aproape 200 de afiliați în Statele Unite și teritoriile sale, dintre care unele sunt disponibile și în Canada și / sau Mexic prin intermediul furnizorilor de televiziune cu plată sau în zonele de frontieră în aer;
NBC menține, de asemenea, acorduri de licențiere de marcă pentru canalele internaționale din Coreea de Sud și Germania.

Întrebare: Un bărbat în vârstă de 42 de ani vine la cabinet pentru evaluarea preoperatorie înainte de a suferi o adrenalectomie programată în 2 săptămâni. Cu o lună în urmă, el a primit îngrijiri în departamentul de urgență pentru dureri la flancul drept după o coliziune auto. În acel moment, tensiunea arterială a fost de 160/100 mm Hg și CT-ul la abdomen a arătat o masă incidentală a glandei suprarenale stângi de 10 cm. Rezultatele studiilor de laborator, inclusiv hemograma, concentrațiile serice de electroliți și testele funcției hepatice, erau în limite normale. Pacientul în rest a fost sănătos și nu i s-a spus niciodată că are tensiune arterială crescută. Nu ia medicamente. O vizită de urmărire în cabinet cu 2 săptămâni în urmă a dezvăluit concentrări crescute de normetanefrină și metanefrină urinare și de aldosteron plasmatic. Pacientul a fost informat despre necesitatea unei intervenții chirurgicale de către un chirurg, care a recomandat adrenalectomia. Astăzi, semne vitale sunt temperatura 36,6°C (97,9°F), puls 100/min, respirații 14/min și tensiune arterială de 170/95 mm Hg. Examenul fizic nu dezvăluie constatări semnificative. Pregătirea preoperatorie inițială ar trebui să includă tratamentul cu una dintre următoarele opțiuni?
Variante:
A. Labetalol
B. O doză de încărcare de clorură de potasiu
C. Nifedipină

Context: Brazilia este cea mai mare țară Romano-Catolică de pe Pământ, iar Biserica Romano-Catolică s-a opus, în mod sistematic, legalizării căsătoriei între persoanele de același sex în țară. Congresul Național al Braziliei a discutat legalizarea timp de 10 ani, iar astfel de căsătorii civile sunt în prezent legale doar în Rio Grande do Sul. Proiectul de lege original a fost elaborat de fostul primar al orașului São Paulo, Marta Suplicy. Legislația propusă este acum în mâinile lui Roberto Jefferson, după ce a fost modificată. Protestatarii speră să colecteze 1,2 milioane de semnături pentru petiție, urmând a o prezenta la Congresul Național din noiembrie.

Fondată în 1926 de către Radio Corporation of America (RCA), NBC este cea mai veche rețea de difuzare majoră din Statele Unite.
La acel moment societatea-mamă a RCA era General Electric (GE).
În 1930, GE a fost forțată să vândă companiile ca urmare a taxelor antitrust.
În 1986, controlul asupra NBC a revenit companiei General Electric (GE) prin achiziționarea RCA de 6,4 miliarde de dolari (GE mai târziu a lichidat RCA, dar a păstrat NBC).
În urma achiziției de către GE, Bob Wright a fost director general al NBC, rămânând în această funcție până la pensionarea sa în 2007, când a fost urmat de Jeff Zucker.
În 2003, compania franceză de media Vivendi și-a fuzionat activele de divertisment cu GE, formând NBC Universal.
Comcast a achiziționat un interes de control în companie în 2011 și a achiziționat pachetul majoritar deținut de General Electric în 2013.
În urma fuziunii Comcast, Zucker a părăsit NBCUniversal și a fost înlocuit ca director general, de Steve Burke, director Comcast.
NBC are 13 posturi deținute și operate și aproape 200 de afiliați în Statele Unite și teritoriile sale, dintre care unele sunt disponibile și în Canada și / sau Mexic prin intermediul furnizorilor de televiziune cu plată sau în zonele de frontieră în aer;
NBC menține, de asemenea, acorduri de licențiere de marcă pentru canalele internaționale din Coreea de Sud și Germania.

Întrebare: Un bărbat în vârstă de 42 de ani vine la cabinet pentru evaluarea preoperatorie înainte de a suferi o adrenalectomie programată în 2 săptămâni. Cu o lună în urmă, el a primit îngrijiri în departamentul de urgență pentru dureri la flancul drept după o coliziune auto. În acel moment, tensiunea arterială a fost de 160/100 mm Hg și CT-ul la abdomen a arătat o masă incidentală a glandei suprarenale stângi de 10 cm. Rezultatele studiilor de laborator, inclusiv hemograma, concentrațiile serice de electroliți și testele funcției hepatice, erau în limite normale. Pacientul în rest a fost sănătos și nu i s-a spus niciodată că are tensiune arterială crescută. Nu ia medicamente. O vizită de urmărire în cabinet cu 2 săptămâni în urmă a dezvăluit concentrări crescute de normetanefrină și metanefrină urinare și de aldosteron plasmatic. Pacientul a fost informat despre necesitatea unei intervenții chirurgicale de către un chirurg, care a recomandat adrenalectomia. Astăzi, semne vitale sunt temperatura 36,6°C (97,9°F), puls 100/min, respirații 14/min și tensiune arterială de 170/95 mm Hg. Examenul fizic nu dezvăluie constatări semnificative. Pregătirea preoperatorie inițială ar trebui să includă tratamentul cu una dintre următoarele opțiuni?
Variante:
A. Labetalol
B. O doză de încărcare de clorură de potasiu
C. Nifedipină
D. Fenoxibenzamină
